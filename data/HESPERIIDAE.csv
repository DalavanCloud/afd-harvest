Braby (2010) pointed out that Lower (1908, p. 312) actually corrected the original spelling to <I>monotherma</I> ?The name is misprinted <I>monotherm</I>.?, and placed it in the genus <I>Hesperilla</I> Hewitson, 1868. The gender of both <I>Telesto</I> Boisduval, 1832, and <I>Hesperilla</I> is feminine, but because <I>monotherm</I> is a noun in apposition the species group name does not need to change. However, since <I>monotherm</I> is an incorrect original spelling that, prior to publication of the Checklist (Atkins & Edwards 1996) has had no usage, Lower?s subsequent correction to <I>monotherma</I> should be maintained","Lower","1908","Y","43b73ff9-9585-42f4-92fa-bb173041f0f8","20170628T07:52:32.371+0000","5510b416-4fac-4b62-b652-eea8f2259aa7","20180213T04:14:18.669+0000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
