Scott Australian Lepidoptera and their transformations (Scott 1890-1898) published by the Australian Museum has been attributed to A. W. Scott (it was published 7-10 years after his death (or to A. S. Olliff & Helena Forde).  Olliff and Forde, on the cover and in the preface, state that their role was in editing and revising the manuscripts of A. W. Scott for publication. The plates were of the same origin as those published by Scott (1864) in the first volume of the book.  In this volume, AW Scott wrote the text and his daughters, Harriette and Helena, prepared and colored the plates.  The new names of the 1st volume have been invariably attributed to AW Scott. Olliff and Forde also stated that they had found it necessary to substitute the nomenclature employed by recent writers  and that they were entirely responsible for the nomenclature adopted. The illustrations had been prepared many years before with  Scott's then novel names. These illustrations were not changed but Scott's names had become junior synonyms by 1890. Olliff and Forde edited the text to use the published names listing Scott's names (on the plates) as synonyms. All the new names in the publication, with one exception, are listed in the synonymy and must be attributed to Scott. The exception is <I>Selidosema gilva</I> (Scott, 1893) for which Olliff and Forde found no senior synonym and so Scott's manuscript name was used with his description. Olliff and Forde's statement that they were responsible for the nomenclature meant the synonymies not the names and descriptions. In this checklist  all the names are attributed to Scott although their status is due to Olliff and Forde. Couchman (1962) makes this distinction in attributing '<I>cassythae</I>' to Scott but its synonomy with <I>erinus</I> to Olliff and Forde.

The second volume of AW Scott Australian Lepidoptera and their transformations (Soctt, 1890-1898) published by the Australian Museum has been attributed to AW Scott (it was published 7-10 years after his death (or to AS Olliff & Helena Forde). Olliff and Forde, on the cover and in the preface, state that their role was in editing and revising the manuscripts of AW Scott for publication. The plates were of the same origin as those published by Scott (1864) in the first volume of the book.  In this volume, AW Scott wrote the text and his daughters, Harriette and Helena, prepared and colored the plates. The new names of the 1st volume have been invariably attributed to AW Scott. Olliff and Forde also stated that they had found it necessary to substitute the nomenclature employed by recent writers  and that they were entirely responsible for the nomenclature adopted. The illustrations had been prepared many years before with Scott's then novel names. These illustrations were not changed but Scott's names had become junior synonyms by 1890.  Olliff and Forde edited the text to use the published names listing Scott's names (on the plates) as synonyms.  All the new names in the publication, with one exception, are listed in the synonymy and must be attributed to Scott.  The exception is <I>Selidosema gilva</I> (Scott, 1893) for which Olliff and Forde found no senior synonym and so Scott's manuscript name was used with his description. Olliff and Forde's statement that they were responsible for the nomenclature meant the synonymies, not the names and descriptions.  In this checklist  all the names are attributed to Scott although their status is due to Olliff and Forde. Couchman (1962) makes this distinction in attributing '<I>cassythae</I>' to Scott but its synonomy with <I>erinus</I> to Olliff and Forde.

Scott Australian Lepidoptera and their transformations (Scott, 1890-1898) published by the Australian Museum has been attributed to A. W. Scott (it was published 7-10 years after his death (or to A. S. Olliff & Helena Forde). Olliff and Forde, on the cover and in the preface, state that their role was in editing and revising the manuscripts of A. W. Scott for publication. The plates were of the same origin as those published by Scott (1864) in the first volume of the book. In this volume, AW Scott wrote the text and his daughters, Harriette and Helena, prepared and colored the plates. The new names of the 1st volume have been invariably attributed to AW Scott. Olliff and Forde also stated that they had found it necessary to substitute the nomenclature employed by recent writers and that they were entirely responsible for the nomenclature adopted. The illustrations had been prepared many years before with Scott's then novel names. These illustrations were not changed but Scott's names had become junior synonyms by 1890. Olliff and Forde edited the text to use the published names listing Scott's names (on the plates) as synonyms. All the new names in the publication, with one exception, are listed in the synonymy and must be attributed to Scott. The exception is <I>Selidosema gilva</I> (Scott, 1893) for which Olliff and Forde found no senior synonym and so Scott's manuscript name was used with his description. Olliff and Forde's statement that they were responsible for the nomenclature meant the synonymies not the names and descriptions. In this checklist all the names are attributed to Scott although their status is due to Olliff and Forde. Couchman (1962) makes this distinction in attributing '<I>cassythae</I>' to Scott but its synonomy with <I>erinus</I> to Olliff and Forde. In the bibliography, as in Musgrave (1932) and Moulds (1977), the volume is attributed to Scott","Scott","1893","Y","9ec9465f-2b07-48f4-bbb8-db893ea821bd","20150429T01:07:51.573+0000","42def009-8478-42de-b1a6-93437ed6754f","20150504T22:14:02.717+0000","","a6614688-17de-46bb-9d59-8876d3e8ac04","Scott, A.W.","1893","Australian Lepidoptera and their transformations, with illustrations drawn from the life by his daughters, Harriet Morgan and Helena Forde.
